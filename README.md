## Installing
Tim Engine is different than other Template Engines because it can be used as a standalone binary application,
so it can be called from any programming language exactly like `zip`, `mkdir`, or `ls`.

In this case there are two ways to install Tim.

As a nimble library for the Nim programming language
```
nimble install tim
```

As a standalone binary app. Compile it by yourself or get the latest version
of Tim from GitHub Releases and set Tim to your working `PATH`
```
ln -s /path/to/your/tim /usr/local/bin
```

Tim Compiler is separated in 2 phases. The first phase is involved in tokenizing the syntax via `Lexer` ‚û§ `Parser` ‚û§ `AST Nodes` Generation,
and saves the AST output for using later in the second phase, `JIT`. In Just-in-time compilation the Compiler resolves `data assignments`,
`conditional statements` and available `loops` or `iterations`.

## Examples

```timl
section > div.container > div.row.vh-100.align-items-center
    div#card-reminder.col-5.mx-auto > div.bg-light.border.p-4.rounded.shadow-sm
        div.row
            div > small.d-block.text-muted.text-uppercase: "Issue No #5"
            div.col-lg-9.col-12 > h1.fw-bold: "Meet great assets for designers üî•"
            div.col-lg-3.col-12.text-center
                div.bg-primary.overflow-hidden
                    img.img-fluid
                        src = "https://imgproxy.generated.photos/7B_3uVLgPR17_HmsbJHTelyufws9nIRSTEE2D_FJmLA/rs:fit:256:256/Z3M6Ly9nZW5lcmF0/ZWQtcGhvdG9zL3Ry/YW5zcGFyZW50X3Yz/L3YzXzA2OTc1Nzgu/cG5n.png"
                        width = "110px"
                    style =
                        border-radius: "42%"
                        width, height: "80px"
        div.row > div.col-12
            p.lead.fw-normal: "Start Exploring Communities you're interested in.<br>The first step to find areas' experts in the rooms"
            div.row
                div.col > a.btn.btn-outline-secondary: "Skip for now"
                div.col > a.btn.btn-dark.d-block: "Join Clubhouse ü§ü"
```

### About Tim Engine

#### Layouts, Views and Partials
A `view` represent a screen page. It can be wrapped in a specific `layout` and can contain multiple `partials`. All files must end with ``.timl`` extension.

#### Variables
Are simple identifiers that reflects your json object `data`. So a variable can be an `array`, `bool`, `float`, `int`, `object`, `null`, or `string`.
Cannot be defined on `runtime`. Also, a variable cannot hold mixed data. And, variables are typed-safe, so their type cannot be changed during `runtime`.

A variable must be always prefixed with `$`. Variables are `case sensitive`, can be `alphanumerical`, and separated with `_` only.

```js
{
    "user": true,
    "is": {
        "admin": true
    },
    "admin": true,

    // invalid examples
    " ": "Just checking...",
    "you-tell-me": 123,
    "lets.try.again": "Okay",
    "user": false
}
```

```tim
if $user == $is.admin
    a href="/dashboard": "Go to dashboard"
else: 
    a href="/profile": "Go to your Profile"

if $admin:
    span: "Fake admin"
```

Variable nodes are generated based on given `JsonNode` and limited to first level of your `Json` nodes only.
So anything deeper than that is just... `json`. You can use `.` annotation to access other levels.

#### Conditionals, Comparison and Logical Operators
Tim knows about the following conditional statements: `if`, `elif` and `else`.

The following Comparison Operators are valid
- [x] Equal `$a == $b`
- [x] Not Equal `$a != $b`
- [x] Greater than `$a > $b`
- [x] Less than `$a < $b`
- [x] Greater than or Equal `$a >= $b`
- [x] Less than or Equal `$a <= $b`

### üëë Discover Nim language
<strong>What's Nim?</strong> Nim is a statically typed compiled systems programming language. It combines successful concepts from mature languages like Python, Ada and Modula. [Find out more about Nim language](https://nim-lang.org/)

<strong>Why Nim?</strong> Performance, fast compilation and C-like freedom. We want to keep code clean, readable, concise, and close to our intention. Also a very good language to learn in 2022.
